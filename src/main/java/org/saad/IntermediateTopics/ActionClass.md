Let’s begin with **Actions Class**, as it is one of the most commonly used features in Selenium.

## **Topic: Actions Class in Selenium**

### **Why Do We Use Actions Class?**
The `Actions` class is used to handle complex user interactions, such as:
- Mouse hover
- Drag-and-drop
- Right-click (context-click)
- Double-click
- Keyboard interactions (e.g., pressing keys like `Ctrl+A`, `Shift`, `Enter`, etc.)

Selenium’s `WebDriver` cannot directly perform these interactions, so `Actions` class provides methods to simulate them.

---

### **Best Practices**
1. Always use `build().perform()` to execute the action.
2. Use Explicit Wait to ensure elements are interactable before performing actions.
3. For keyboard actions, ensure the focus is on the correct element.
4. Handle exceptions like `MoveTargetOutOfBoundsException` when dealing with dynamic UI.

---

### **Commonly Used Methods in Actions Class**
1. `moveToElement(WebElement)` – For mouse hover.
2. `clickAndHold(WebElement)` – To click and hold an element.
3. `release(WebElement)` – To release the held element.
4. `dragAndDrop(WebElement, WebElement)` – For drag-and-drop functionality.
5. `contextClick(WebElement)` – For right-click.
6. `doubleClick(WebElement)` – For double-click.
7. `sendKeys(CharSequence)` – For keyboard interactions.

### **Code Snippets**

#### 1. **Mouse Hover Example**
```java
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.get("https://example.com");

WebElement menu = driver.findElement(By.id("menu-item"));
Actions actions = new Actions(driver);

// Hover over menu
actions.moveToElement(menu).build().perform();
System.out.println("Mouse hovered on menu");
```

---

#### 2. **Right-Click (Context Click) Example**
```java
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("context-menu-item"));
Actions actions = new Actions(driver);

// Right-click on the element
actions.contextClick(element).build().perform();
System.out.println("Right-click performed");
```

---

#### 3. **Drag and Drop Example**
```java
WebElement source = driver.findElement(By.id("source-element"));
WebElement target = driver.findElement(By.id("target-element"));

Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
// Drag source to target
actions.dragAndDrop(source, target).build().perform();
System.out.println("Drag and drop performed");
```

---

#### 4. **Keyboard Interaction Example**
```java
WebElement inputBox = driver.findElement(By.id("input-box"));
Actions actions = new Actions(driver);

// Send keyboard keys (e.g., Ctrl+A, Delete)
actions.click(inputBox)
       .keyDown(Keys.CONTROL)
       .sendKeys("a")
       .keyUp(Keys.CONTROL)
       .sendKeys(Keys.DELETE)
       .build().perform();
System.out.println("Keyboard interaction performed");
```

### **Interview Q&A**

#### **Q1. What is the purpose of the Actions class in Selenium?**
**Answer:**  
The `Actions` class in Selenium is used to handle complex user interactions like mouse hover, drag-and-drop, right-click, double-click, and keyboard actions that cannot be performed using standard `WebDriver` methods.

---

#### **Q2. How do you perform a mouse hover action using the Actions class?**
**Answer:**  
To perform a mouse hover:
```java
Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
actions.moveToElement(element).build().perform();
```
The `moveToElement` method moves the mouse pointer to the specified element.

---

#### **Q3. What is the difference between `click()` and `contextClick()` in Actions class?**
**Answer:**
- `click()` performs a left mouse button click.
- `contextClick()` performs a right mouse button click (context menu).

---

#### **Q4. What is the significance of `build()` and `perform()` in Actions class?**
**Answer:**
- **`build()`** compiles all the actions into a single step.
- **`perform()`** executes the compiled actions.  
  These are used together to execute a sequence of actions.

---

#### **Q5. How do you perform drag-and-drop using the Actions class?**
**Answer:**  
Using the `dragAndDrop` method:
```java
actions.dragAndDrop(sourceElement, targetElement).build().perform();
```
It drags the source element and drops it onto the target element.

---

#### **Q6. Can you perform keyboard actions using the Actions class? Give an example.**
**Answer:**  
Yes, the `Actions` class provides methods like `sendKeys()` and `keyDown()` to perform keyboard interactions. Example:
```java
actions.keyDown(Keys.CONTROL).sendKeys("a").keyUp(Keys.CONTROL).perform();
```

---

#### **Q7. What are some common exceptions in the Actions class?**
**Answer:**
- `MoveTargetOutOfBoundsException` – When the target element is outside the viewable area.
- `ElementNotInteractableException` – When the element is not interactable.
